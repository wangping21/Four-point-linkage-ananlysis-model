# Four-point-linkage-ananlysis-model
We implemented four-point linkage analysis to landscape a detailed picture of how CO interference is distributed through the entire genome of Populus euphratica, the only forest tree that can survive and grow in saline desert. We identified an extensive occurrence of CO interference, but found that its strength depends on the length of chromosomes and the genomic locations within the chromosome.(res1(data).csv is used as the result file; data.RData and Populus euphratica.outcross.csv are used as the original data.)
